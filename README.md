# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Market Regime Detection using Hidden Markov Models ðŸ“ˆ

This project applies **unsupervised machine learning**,  specifically **Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)** to detect **hidden market regimes** (e.g., bull vs bear markets) using historical price data of the S&P 500 (SPY ETF). It also demonstrates how regime detection can guide a simple **risk-on/risk-off trading strategy**.

## Project Overview

Traditional financial models often assume markets are stable over time â€” but in reality, they go through distinct phases or "regimes." This project aims to:

- Detect hidden market regimes using **HMMs**
- Engineer features like log returns, volatility, and momentum
- Label each time period with a regime (e.g., bull, bear, neutral)
- Build a **strategy** that only invests during favorable regimes
- Compare performance vs buy-and-hold benchmark

##  Tools & Technologies

- Python 
- `yfinance` for historical data
- `hmmlearn` for HMM modeling
- `pandas`, `numpy` for data manipulation
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for visualization
- Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab compatible)

---

## Features Used

- Log returns
- Rolling volatility
- Price momentum
- Regime mapping based on predicted HMM states

---

##  Strategy Logic

The backtest applies a simple rule:
- **Invest only in regimes that appear historically profitable**
- **Stay in cash** (or reduce exposure) during bearish regimes

Returns are compared with a passive buy-and-hold portfolio.

---

##  Results

- The model successfully segments the market into distinct behavioral regimes.
- While the default model avoids some downturns, it may underperform buy-and-hold without tuning.
- You can improve results by adjusting:
  - Number of regimes
  - Feature set
  - Strategy rules
